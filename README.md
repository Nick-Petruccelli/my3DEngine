<h1>My 3D Engine</h1>
<h2>Introduction: </h2>
In this project I wanted to create a 3D engine utilizing openGL in order to alow me to work on future projects that would require rendering a 3D scene such a a game or physics simulation.
A secondary reason for wanting to do this project was to learn more about how to write and maintain a project in C that was larger than just a few files which definatly brings a new level of chalange to the development process.
<h2>Components: </h2>
<h3>Scene Managment: </h3>
This portion of the project was responsibel for keeping track of all of the objects and light scources in the scene and there position and rotations
<h3>Math Library: </h3>
Graphics programing requiers a lot of linear algebra so I decided to write my own math liberary to handel this.
<h3>Shaders: </h3>
Utilized GLSL to write the fragment and vertex shaders for the render pipeline, this included calqulating shadows, specular highlights and diffusion.
